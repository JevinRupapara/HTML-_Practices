			<p>With his wife Melinda, Bill Gates chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private charitable foundation. 
				<br>
				In May 2020, the Gates Foundation said it would spend $300 million to fight the coronavirus pandemic, funding treatment, detection and vaccines.
				<br>
				Gates has sold or given away much of his stake in Microsoft -- he owns just over 1% of shares -- and invested in a mix of stocks and other assets.
				<br>
				In mid-March 2020, Gates stepped down as a board member of Microsoft, the software firm he founded with Paul Allen (d. 2018) in 1975.
				<br>
				The foundation works to improve global health and to create equal opportunity for people around the globe.
				<br>
				To date, Gates has donated $35.8 billion worth of Microsoft stock to the Gates Foundation.
